            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT BleÅ¿Å¿ed Work, which is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subject of theÅ¿e following Narratives, was begun about Fourty or Fifty Years ago: And there were then PubliÅ¿hed, for Three or Four Years Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively, Å¿everal Prints giving account of its ProgreÅ¿s, under the Titles of, <hi>The Day daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Strength out of WeakneÅ¿s,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tears of Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. to the great rejoycing of the Hearts of many Precious Saints of that Day. Since that Time, there hath been but little (that I know of) Communicated to the Publick, concerning that Affair; Å¿ave only that Letter from my Dear Brother, Mr. <hi>IncreaÅ¿e Mather,</hi> to Doctor <hi>John LeuÅ¿den</hi> of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> which is here InÅ¿erted, and which was (Å¿oon after it was Received) Printed in Latine, as it was Written; and alÅ¿o TranÅ¿lated into <hi>French,</hi> and into <hi>EngliÅ¿h;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> TranÅ¿lation Printed in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>Latine</hi> and the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> here in <hi>London;</hi> firÅ¿t by it Å¿elf, and the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> again afterward in the Story of the Life of Mr. <hi>John Eliot,</hi> by my Dear Nephew Mr.<pb facs="tcp:104473:5"/>

            <p>I have already told my Reader, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this People was the beÅ¿t of all Governments, <hi>Monarchy;</hi> and it has been judged not without reaÅ¿on, that a main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction in the progreÅ¿s of the GoÅ¿pel in the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, <hi>was,</hi> if not yet <hi>is,</hi> the jealouÅ¿y the Princes conceived of the InvaÅ¿ion of their <hi>Government</hi> through the pretences of Religion, and the EclipÅ¿ing their <hi>Monarchical Dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ever Honoured <hi>Thomas Mayhew</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding that the Princes on theÅ¿e IÅ¿lands, who although they maintained their abÅ¿olute Power and JuriÅ¿diction as <hi>Kings;</hi> were yet bound to doe certain Homage to a <hi>Potent Prince</hi> on the Continent: and although they were no great People, yet had been waÅ¿ted<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104473:21"/>by <hi>InteÅ¿tine Wars,</hi> wherein the great Princes on the Continent (not unlike <hi>European</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for like <hi>ReaÅ¿ons of State</hi>) were not unaÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby they were neceÅ¿Å¿itated to make theÅ¿e Princes the <hi>ballance</hi> to decide their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverÅ¿ies, and Å¿everal JuriÅ¿dictions, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ents annually Å¿ent, whereby obliging the Princes to give their Å¿everal AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion required: and Å¿eeing his Son as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid in a zealous indeavour for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion, he judged it meet that <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> joyn hands; he therefore prudently lets them know, that by order from his MaÅ¿ter the King of <hi>England,</hi> he was to Govern the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> which Å¿hould inhabit theÅ¿e IÅ¿lands; that his MaÅ¿ter was in Power far above any of the <hi>Indian Monarches;</hi> but that as he was powerful, Å¿o was he a great lover of <hi>JuÅ¿tice;</hi> that therefore he would in no meaÅ¿ure invade there <hi>JuriÅ¿dictions;</hi> but on the contrary AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them as need required; that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment</hi> were diÅ¿tinct things. Thus in no long time they conceived no ill Opinion of the <hi>ChriÅ¿tian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When afterwards the number of the <hi>ChriÅ¿tian Indians</hi> were increaÅ¿ed among them, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waded them to admit of the <hi>CounÅ¿els</hi> of the <hi>Judicious ChriÅ¿tians</hi> among themÅ¿elves, and in caÅ¿es of more than ordinary conÅ¿equence of<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104473:22"/>a <hi>Jury</hi> for Tryal; when likewiÅ¿e he promiÅ¿ed his AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance and Direction with the <hi>Prince;</hi> when notwithÅ¿tanding the <hi>Princes aÅ¿Å¿ent</hi> was to be obtained, though he were <hi>no ChriÅ¿tian.</hi> Thus within a few years there was a happy Government Å¿ettled among them, and <hi>Records</hi> kept of all Actions and <hi>Acts</hi> paÅ¿Å¿ed in their Å¿everal Courts, by Å¿uch who having learned to <hi>Write</hi> fairly were appointed thereto. The <hi>Princes</hi> with their <hi>Sachims</hi> (or Nobles) made Publick acknowledgment of their Subjection to the King of <hi>England,</hi> being nothwithÅ¿tanding mindful to be underÅ¿tood as Subordinate Princes, to Govern according to the Laws of God and the <hi>King.</hi> Here I Å¿hall take leave to inÅ¿ert two Remarkables.</p>
            <p>During the late unhappy War between the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> about Nineteen years Å¿ince; an <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed too many of our <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> whereby they Å¿uffered themÅ¿elves to be unreaÅ¿onably exaÅ¿perated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t all <hi>Indians;</hi> of Å¿uch there were Å¿ome on theÅ¿e IÅ¿lands, who could hardly be Å¿o moderated by Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> and others in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with him, as to be reÅ¿trained from riÅ¿ing to aÅ¿Å¿ay the diÅ¿arming of the Indians; for whoÅ¿e Å¿atisfaction Capt. <hi>Richard SarÅ¿on</hi> 
               <abbr>EÅ¿q</abbr> was ordered with a Å¿mall party (the Indians being on theÅ¿e IÅ¿lands Twenty to one, having
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104473:22"/>Arms) to Treat the Indians on the WeÅ¿t end of <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> who were moÅ¿tly to be doubted: he returns with the inÅ¿uing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer: That the delivering their Arms would expoÅ¿e them to the will of the <hi>Indians</hi> ingaged in the preÅ¿ent War, who were not leÅ¿s theirs than the Enemies of the EngliÅ¿h; that they had never given occaÅ¿ion of the <hi>diÅ¿truÅ¿t</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; if in any thing not hazarding their Å¿afety, they could give any Satisfaction for proof of their <hi>Fidelity,</hi> they would willingly attend what Å¿hould reaÅ¿onably be demanded of them; but they were unwilling to deliver their Arms, unleÅ¿s the EngliÅ¿h would propoÅ¿e Å¿ome means for their Å¿afety and livelihoood: With this Return they drew a <hi>Writing</hi> in their own Language, which I have often read, and would have <hi>Verbatim</hi> inÅ¿erted, but cannot at preÅ¿ent find it; the SubÅ¿tance was, that as they had Submitted to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> Å¿o they reÅ¿olved to <hi>AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the EngliÅ¿h</hi> on theÅ¿e IÅ¿lands againÅ¿t <hi>their</hi> Enemies, which they eÅ¿teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Å¿ame reÅ¿pect equally <hi>their own,</hi> as Subjects to the Å¿ame <hi>King;</hi> which was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the PerÅ¿ons of greateÅ¿t note among them.</p>
            <p>Having this anÅ¿wer, the Government reÅ¿olved, and accordingly improved them as a guard, furniÅ¿hing them with Å¿uitable Ammunition, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104473:23"/>found them Å¿o faithful that even Å¿ome nearly related, in obÅ¿ervance of general inÅ¿tructions given them, Å¿o Å¿oon as they landed from the Continent, were immediately brought before the Governour, to attend his pleaÅ¿ure; inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> (although the War, with reÅ¿pect to the multitude of Indians inhabiting the Continent, and their advantage by the nearneÅ¿s to the <hi>French</hi> had no good aÅ¿pect) took no care, but left the whole to the <hi>Indians;</hi> nothing doubting to be advertiÅ¿ed by them of any danger from the Enemy. This was the effect of the bringing the <hi>GoÅ¿pel of Peace</hi> among them, <hi>Viz. a Peace-bringing GoÅ¿pel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other obÅ¿ervable I Å¿hall add to Å¿how as their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> Å¿o their obÅ¿ervance of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the time of the late <hi>Revolution,</hi> when man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in hopes there was <hi>no King in IÅ¿rael,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have done what they Å¿aw good in their own eyes: Several of our <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to fetch certain <hi>Sheep</hi> in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the Indians inhabiting a Å¿mall IÅ¿land Adjacent to <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> which Sheep they aÅ¿Å¿erted were Stolen from them, who met with repulÅ¿e; the <hi>Sachim</hi> leaÅ¿t there Å¿hould happen any miÅ¿underÅ¿tanding of that matter, immediately<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104473:23"/>makes his report to me in theÅ¿e words, <hi>Viz. Several of your EngliÅ¿h have been on my IÅ¿land, and would have forceably taken Sheep from thence; and we are much threatned therewith; I am doubtful if they perÅ¿iÅ¿t in that ReÅ¿olution, it may OccaÅ¿ion Blood-Å¿hed: you know that while your Grand-father and my Father lived, there never happened any difference in Å¿uch things, nor hope will be OccaÅ¿ion given by me. I deÅ¿ire the Å¿ame Amity may be continued, nor can the EngliÅ¿h Å¿ay, that we have not manifeÅ¿ted our Allegiance to the King by a continued Subjection. And although it is true, we have deÅ¿ired your Order Å¿hould come to us, rather than your Officer, which hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been obÅ¿erved; yet we are willing in CaÅ¿e the EngliÅ¿h pretend any thing ours have injured them in; let an Officer by writ from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doe his duty, then we Å¿hall know how in an orderly way, to be relieved; yet Å¿hall the leaÅ¿t Boy bringing your Order, as in your Grand-fathers time, Command any thing: And if you Å¿ee cauÅ¿e on any complaint about our Sheep, your may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all of them; hoping to find as hitherto a deciÅ¿ion by the Rules of JuÅ¿tice: We hope we Å¿hall not Å¿ee (as is too much practiÅ¿ed in other places) an EngliÅ¿h-man, pretending an Indian to be in his debt, to come to our HouÅ¿es and pay himÅ¿elf; or in other caÅ¿es beat our People; but as hitherto we may have equal JuÅ¿tice, being the King Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and Violence and Riot committed on our<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104473:24"/>People by the EngliÅ¿h may be eÅ¿teemed of the Å¿ame nature and quality as ours againÅ¿t them; of which, with the JuÅ¿tices, we pray you would ConÅ¿ider, and take Å¿peedy care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Å¿hall as to their <hi>Government</hi> only add; that in their Å¿everal <hi>Plantations</hi> or <hi>Town-Å¿hips,</hi> they Elect <hi>three</hi> or more to joyn with the <hi>Sachims</hi> (or Lords of the place) who hold <hi>Courts,</hi> for iÅ¿Å¿uing Å¿uch ControverÅ¿ies as happen among them, the <hi>Sachim</hi> preÅ¿iding in Å¿uch Courts, or in caÅ¿e <hi>he</hi> decline that Office, another is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in his place: if either party diÅ¿like the Judgment given, he Appeals to a <hi>Superiour Court,</hi> which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts of Å¿ome of the moÅ¿t eÅ¿teemed of each place, being Å¿ome of their <hi>MagiÅ¿trates,</hi> where Å¿ome <hi>Principal Sachims</hi> is Elected to preÅ¿ide for one Year: and from this Court an Appeal lyes to the <hi>EngliÅ¿h Court.</hi> In giving Judgment, they obÅ¿erve Å¿uch rules and orders made and recorded among themÅ¿elves, and the <hi>EngliÅ¿h Law,</hi> the knowledge whereof they much aÅ¿pire unto. They have likewiÅ¿e Å¿ome among them, whom the leÅ¿s able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, or defend their own CaÅ¿es, imploy as <hi>Attornies;</hi> Å¿ome of which are to admiration <hi>Critical</hi> in their pleadings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104473:24"/>I Å¿hall cloÅ¿e the whole when I have told the Reader, that their Children are generally taught to <hi>Read,</hi> and many to <hi>Write;</hi> in one of their Towns the laÅ¿t Winter, <hi>Viz.</hi> 1693. <hi>Thirty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> were at School, Twenty more of the Å¿ame place, at the Å¿ame time, accidentally, being not Å¿upplyed with Books, could not attend it.

                  <p>That there are <hi>Five Hundred</hi> and <hi>Five</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult PerÅ¿ons of <hi>Indians,</hi> within the Limits of our TownÅ¿hip, unto whom theÅ¿e many years paÅ¿t, I have from time to time imparted the GoÅ¿pel of our LORD JESUS, in their own Language, (and I truly hope not without SucceÅ¿s); and yet I continue in the Å¿ame Service, earneÅ¿tly imploring, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes expecting, and waiting for a more plentiful down-powring of the Spirit from on high among them: and I verily doe not know of, nor can I learn that there is Å¿o much as one of theÅ¿e <hi>Five Hundred Indians,</hi> that do's obÅ¿tinately abÅ¿ent from, but do joyntly frequent and attend on the<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104473:29"/>Preaching of the Word, and countenance the Å¿ame, not only frequenting and attending Å¿eaÅ¿ons of WorÅ¿hip of a divine Sanction, but alÅ¿o all other occaÅ¿ional Opportunies, when the GoÅ¿pel is diÅ¿penÅ¿ed to them; and when our Congregations Solemnize Publick Days of <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>FaÅ¿ting</hi> or of <hi>PraiÅ¿es</hi> (I uÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally giving them AdvertiÅ¿ement thereof) they readily comply therewith, in their reÅ¿pective AÅ¿Å¿emblies. They have four diÅ¿tinct AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in four Villages belonging to our TownÅ¿hip, in which four AÅ¿Å¿emblies, they have four Teachers of their own choice, of the more <hi>Sober,</hi> well <hi>Affected</hi> and <hi>

                  <p>There are in the four aboveÅ¿aid Villages, four <hi>School-maÅ¿ters</hi> (of the beÅ¿t accompliÅ¿ht for that Service) who teach their <hi>Youth</hi> to <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Write</hi> their own Language.</p>
                  <p>There are alÅ¿o Six <hi>JuÅ¿tices</hi> of the Peace (or MagiÅ¿trates) in the four aboveÅ¿aid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, who regulate their Civil Affairs, and PuniÅ¿h Criminals and TranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ors of the

                  <p>There are among them, many of a <hi>Serious, Å¿ober, civilized</hi> ConverÅ¿ation and Deportment, who are making EÅ¿Å¿ays towards a further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ive Å¿tep of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Rules of the GoÅ¿pel, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, having a great deÅ¿ire to be <hi>Baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are very Serviceable by their Labour to the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Vicinity, and have all along Å¿ince our <hi>Wars</hi> with their Nation, been very Friendly to the <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> and forward to Å¿erve them in that quarrel.

            <p>YOUR Letters were very grateful to me, by which I underÅ¿tand that you and others in your famous UniverÅ¿ity of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>trecht,</hi> deÅ¿ire to be informed concerning the Converted <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> Take therefore a True Account of them in a few words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104473:34"/>It is above forty Years Å¿ince that truly godly Man, Mr, <hi>John Elliot,</hi> PaÅ¿tour of the Church at <hi>Rocksborough,</hi> (not above a Mile from <hi>BoÅ¿ton</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>) being warmed with a holy Zeal of Coverting the <hi>Americans,</hi> Å¿et himÅ¿elf to learn the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, that he might more eaÅ¿ily and Å¿ucceÅ¿sfully open to them the MyÅ¿teries of the GoÅ¿pel; upon account of which he has been (and not undeÅ¿ervedly) called, <hi>The ApoÅ¿tle of the American Indians.</hi> This Reverend PerÅ¿on, not without very great labour, TranÅ¿lated the whole Bible into the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue; he TranÅ¿lated alÅ¿o Å¿everal <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> TreatiÅ¿es of Practical Divinity, and CatechiÅ¿ms into their Language: Above 26 Years agoe he gathered a Church of Converted <hi>Indians</hi> in a Town called <hi>Natick;</hi> theÅ¿e <hi>Indians</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿ed their Å¿ins with Tears, and profeÅ¿Å¿ed their Faith in ChriÅ¿t, and afterwards they and their Children were Baptized, and they were Å¿olemnly joyned together in a Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the Å¿aid Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> was the firÅ¿t that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tred the Lords Supper to them. The PaÅ¿tor of that Church now is an <hi>Indian,</hi> his Name is <hi>Daniel.</hi> BeÅ¿ides this Church at <hi>Natick,</hi> among our Inhabitants in the <hi>MaÅ¿Å¿achuÅ¿etts</hi> Colony there are four <hi>Indian</hi> AÅ¿Å¿emblies, where the Name of the True God and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is Å¿olemnly called upon; theÅ¿e AÅ¿Å¿emblies have<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104473:34"/>
               <hi>American</hi> Preachers. Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> formerly uÅ¿ed to preach to them once every Fortnight, but now he is weakned with Labours and Old-age, being in the Eighty Fourth Year of his Age, and preacheth not to the <hi>Indians</hi> oftner than once in two Months.</p>
            <p>There is another Church, conÅ¿iÅ¿ting only of Converted <hi>Indians,</hi> about fifty Miles from hence, in an <hi>Indian</hi> Town called <hi>MarÅ¿hippang,</hi> the firÅ¿t PaÅ¿tor in that Church was an <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Man, who being skilful in the <hi>American</hi> Language, Preached the GoÅ¿pel to them in their own Tongue. This <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> PaÅ¿tor is dead, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleÅ¿s that Church has an <hi>Indian</hi> Preacher.</p>
            <p>There are beÅ¿ides that, five AÅ¿Å¿emblies of <hi>Indians</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿ing the Name of ChriÅ¿t, not far diÅ¿tant from <hi>MarÅ¿hippang,</hi> which have <hi>Indian</hi> Preachers: <hi>John Cotton</hi> PaÅ¿tor of the Church at <hi>Plymouth</hi> (Son of my venerable Father-in-law <hi>John Cotton,</hi> formerly the famous Teacher of the Church at <hi>BoÅ¿ton</hi>) hath made very great progreÅ¿s in learning the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, and is very skilful in it; he Preaches in their own Language to the laÅ¿t five mentioned Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions every Week. Moreover of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Saconet</hi> in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony, there is a great Congregation of thoÅ¿e who for diÅ¿tinction Å¿ake are called <hi>Praying Indians,</hi> becauÅ¿e they pray to God in ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104473:35"/>Not far from a Promontory called <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> there are Å¿ix AÅ¿Å¿emblies of Heathens who are to be reckoned as <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> amongÅ¿t whom there are Six <hi>Indian</hi> Preachers: <hi>Samuel Treat,</hi> PaÅ¿tor of a Church at <hi>EaÅ¿tham,</hi> Preacheth to thoÅ¿e Congregations in their own Language. There are likewiÅ¿e amongÅ¿t the IÅ¿landers of <hi>Nantuchett</hi> a Church, with a PaÅ¿tor who was lately a Heathen, and Å¿everal Meetings of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeni's,</hi> who are InÅ¿tructed by the Converted <hi>Indians.</hi> There is alÅ¿o another IÅ¿land, about Seven Leagues long, (called <hi>Martha's Vineyard</hi>) where are Two <hi>American</hi> Churches planted, which are more Famous than the reÅ¿t; over one of which there preÅ¿ides an Ancient <hi>Indian</hi> as PaÅ¿tor, called <hi>Hiacooms: John Hiacooms,</hi> Son of the Å¿aid <hi>Indian</hi> PaÅ¿tor, alÅ¿o preacheth the GoÅ¿pel to his Countrey-Men. Another Church in that place <hi>John TechinoÅ¿h</hi> a Converted <hi>Indian</hi> teaches. In theÅ¿e Churches Ruling Elders of the <hi>Indians</hi> are Joyned to the PaÅ¿tors; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tors were choÅ¿en by the people, and when they had faÅ¿ted and prayed, Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> laid their Hands on them, Å¿o that they were Å¿olemnly Ordained. All the Congregations of the Converted <hi>Indians</hi> (both the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> and thoÅ¿e that are in Church Order) every Lords Day meet together, the PaÅ¿tor or Preacher al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes begins with Prayer, and without a Form,<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104473:35"/>becauÅ¿e from the Heart; when the Ruler of the AÅ¿Å¿embly has ended his Prayer, the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Indians</hi> praiÅ¿e God with Å¿inging; Å¿ome of them are excellent Singers: After the <hi>PÅ¿alm,</hi> he that preaches reads a place of Scripture (one or more VerÅ¿es as he will) and expounds it, gathers Doctrines from it, proves them by Scripture and ReaÅ¿ons, and inferrs UÅ¿es from them after the manner of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> of whom they have been taught; then another Prayer to God in the Name of ChriÅ¿t concludes the whole Service. Thus do they meet together twice every Lords-day: They obÅ¿erve no <hi>Holy-dayes</hi> but the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> except upon Å¿ome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaÅ¿ion, and then they Å¿olemnly Å¿et a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part whole days, either in giving Thanks or faÅ¿ting and praying with great Å¿ervour of Mind.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> came into theÅ¿e CoaÅ¿ts, theÅ¿e barbarous Nations were altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the True God; hence it is that in their Prayers and Sermons they uÅ¿e <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Words and Terms; he that calls upon the moÅ¿t Holy Name of God, Å¿ays, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> and alÅ¿o they have learned and borrowed many other Theological PhraÅ¿es from us. In Å¿hort, there are Å¿ix Churches of Baptized <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and Eighteen AÅ¿Å¿emblies of <hi>Catechumeni's,</hi> profeÅ¿Å¿ing the Name of ChriÅ¿t.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104473:36"/>Of the <hi>Indians</hi> there are Four and Twenty who are Preachers of the Word of God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides theÅ¿e, there are Four EngliÅ¿h MiniÅ¿ters who Preach the GoÅ¿pel in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue. I am now my Å¿elf weary with Writing, and I fear leaÅ¿t if I Å¿hould add more I Å¿hould alÅ¿o be tedious to you; yet one thing I muÅ¿t add, (which I had almoÅ¿t forgot) That there are many of the <hi>Indian</hi> Children who have learned by heart the CatechiÅ¿m, either of that Famous Divine Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> or that put forth by the AÅ¿Å¿embly of Divines at <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter,</hi> and in their own Mother-Tongue can AnÅ¿wer to all the QueÅ¿tions in it. But I muÅ¿t end. I Salute the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors in your UniverÅ¿ity; to whom I deÅ¿ire you to Communicate this Letter, as Written to them alÅ¿o. Farewell, <hi>Worthy Sir;</hi> the Lord preÅ¿erve your Health for the Benefit of your Country, his Church, and of Learning.</p>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THAT Bleſſed Work, which is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subject of theſe following Narratives, was begun about Fourty or Fifty Years ago: And there were then Publiſhed, for Three or Four Years ſucceſſively, ſeveral Prints giving account of its Progreſs, under the Titles of, <hi>The Day daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Strength out of Weakneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tears of Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. to the great rejoycing of the Hearts of many Precious Saints of that Day. Since that Time, there hath been but little (that I know of) Communicated to the Publick, concerning that Affair; ſave only that Letter from my Dear Brother, Mr. <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> to Doctor <hi>John Leuſden</hi> of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> which is here Inſerted, and which was (ſoon after it was Received) Printed in Latine, as it was Written; and alſo Tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> and into <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation Printed in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>Latine</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here in <hi>London;</hi> firſt by it ſelf, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> again afterward in the Story of the Life of Mr. <hi>John Eliot,</hi> by my Dear Nephew Mr.<pb facs="tcp:104473:5"/>

            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> about 130 Years ago, endeavoured to amuſe the World by their <hi>Epiſtolae Indicae,</hi> and other Prints, with Stories of the Converſions wrought by them, and their Companions, in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and Adjacent Iſles. But, as many of the Stories which they tell are palpable and impudent Impoſtures, ſo if all that they vaunt of their Converſions were true, no milder Cenſure of them can be given than that which Chriſt paſſeth on the Converſions made by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who (he tells us) compaſſed Sea and Land to make one Proſelyte; and when he was made, he became twofold more a Child of Hell than they who proſelyted him Of the Juſtneſs of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there needs no other Evidence than that Book Entituled, <hi>Manuale ad Sacramenta Eccleſiae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtranda,</hi> D.

But ſurely there may be Real Converts to Chriſt, True and Pure<pb facs="tcp:104473:6"/>Churches, and Acceptable Worſhip tendred up to God, without thoſe Things which the Scripture knoweth nothing of. The truth is, thoſe Perſons whom the Lord hath uſed and honoured in this Bleſſed Work, have no more fondneſs for ſuch Things, than the Zealots for them have for the Preaching and Propogating of the Goſpel. But be Men of what Perſwaſion ſoever, if they be good, and be of Holy <hi>Paul</hi>'s Spirit, they will nevertheleſs rejoice, That however Chriſt is Preached and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among thoſe who, they and their Fore-fathers for many Generations, even beyond all Memory or Record, ſate in Darkneſs, and in the Region and Shadow of Death, if ever any did. Theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults upon the ſo long quietly continued Poſſeſſion of the Devil, and the reſcuing ſo many of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Thralls from his Power, it is likely hath much inraged him againſt <hi>New-England,</hi> and cauſed him to bear a ſingular Spite to that Plantation: And certain it is, he hath by his Inſtruments raiſed more Trouble to thoſe Colonies, than to any other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Work of Goſpellizing the Barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> hath been ſet on foot ſo ſoon; kept alive ſo long, and carried on to ſuch a Progreſs, by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> ſhould be lookt upon as a Real upbraiding of the other Colonies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in thoſe Goings-down of the Sun, for their great Neglectfulneſs of it. Never let it be ſaid, nor let there be occaſion given for it to be thought, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy, Liturgy, and Ceremonies,
<pb facs="tcp:104473:6"/>will not admit of the Goſpel's being Preached to blind periſhing Heathens, that they might be ſaved; nor that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſers and Approvers thereof can have no Heart or Zeal for ſuch a Good Work. O that what of that kind hath been done in <hi>New England,</hi> might provoke others to an earneſt Imitation of this Example, and an holy Emulation of them in this Work ſo manifeſtly tending to the Glory of Chriſt!

            <p>That the <hi>Powaw's</hi> by the Infernal Spirits often <hi>killed</hi> Perſons, cauſed <hi>Lameneſs</hi> and <hi>Impotency,</hi> as well as ſhewed their Art in performing things, beyond <hi>Humane,</hi> by <hi>Diabolick</hi> Skill, ſuch who have converſed much among them have had no reaſon to queſtion.</p>
            <p>Their practiſe was, either by deſiring the <hi>Spirit</hi> to them appearing to perform, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they intended; or to form a piece of <hi>Leather</hi> like an <hi>Arrow-head,</hi> tying a hair there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: or uſing ſome <hi>Bone,</hi> as of <hi>Fiſh</hi> (that it might be known Witchcraft, to the bewitched) over which they performed certain <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and diſmiſſed them to Effect their deſire.

            <p>When afterwards the number of the <hi>Chriſtian Indians</hi> were increaſed among them, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to admit of the <hi>Counſels</hi> of the <hi>Judicious Chriſtians</hi> among themſelves, and in caſes of more than ordinary conſequence of<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104473:22"/>a <hi>Jury</hi> for Tryal; when likewiſe he promiſed his Aſſiſtance and Direction with the <hi>Prince;</hi> when notwithſtanding the <hi>Princes aſſent</hi> was to be obtained, though he were <hi>no Chriſtian.</hi> Thus within a few years there was a happy Government ſettled among them, and <hi>Records</hi> kept of all Actions and <hi>Acts</hi> paſſed in their ſeveral Courts, by ſuch who having learned to <hi>Write</hi> fairly were appointed thereto. The <hi>Princes</hi> with their <hi>Sachims</hi> (or Nobles) made Publick acknowledgment of their Subjection to the King of <hi>England,</hi> being nothwithſtanding mindful to be underſtood as Subordinate Princes, to Govern according to the Laws of God and the <hi>King.</hi> Here I ſhall take leave to inſert two Remarkables.</p>
            <p>During the late unhappy War between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> about Nineteen years ſince; an <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> poſſeſſed too many of our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereby they ſuffered themſelves to be unreaſonably exaſperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>Indians;</hi> of ſuch there were ſome on theſe Iſlands, who could hardly be ſo moderated by Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> and others in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with him, as to be reſtrained from riſing to aſſay the diſarming of the Indians; for whoſe ſatisfaction Capt. <hi>Richard Sarſon</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was ordered with a ſmall party (the Indians being on theſe Iſlands Twenty to one, having
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104473:22"/>Arms) to Treat the Indians on the Weſt end of <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> who were moſtly to be doubted: he returns with the inſuing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: That the delivering their Arms would expoſe them to the will of the <hi>Indians</hi> ingaged in the preſent War, who were not leſs theirs than the Enemies of the Engliſh; that they had never given occaſion of the <hi>diſtruſt</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; if in any thing not hazarding their ſafety, they could give any Satisfaction for proof of their <hi>Fidelity,</hi> they would willingly attend what ſhould reaſonably be demanded of them; but they were unwilling to deliver their Arms, unleſs the Engliſh would propoſe ſome means for their ſafety and livelihoood: With this Return they drew a <hi>Writing</hi> in their own Language, which I have often read, and would have <hi>Verbatim</hi> inſerted, but cannot at preſent find it; the Subſtance was, that as they had Submitted to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſo they reſolved to <hi>Aſſiſt the Engliſh</hi> on theſe Iſlands againſt <hi>their</hi> Enemies, which they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame reſpect equally <hi>their own,</hi> as Subjects to the ſame <hi>King;</hi> which was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the Perſons of greateſt note among them.</p>
            <p>Having this anſwer, the Government reſolved, and accordingly improved them as a guard, furniſhing them with ſuitable Ammunition, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104473:23"/>found them ſo faithful that even ſome nearly related, in obſervance of general inſtructions given them, ſo ſoon as they landed from the Continent, were immediately brought before the Governour, to attend his pleaſure; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (although the War, with reſpect to the multitude of Indians inhabiting the Continent, and their advantage by the nearneſs to the <hi>French</hi> had no good aſpect) took no care, but left the whole to the <hi>Indians;</hi> nothing doubting to be advertiſed by them of any danger from the Enemy. This was the effect of the bringing the <hi>Goſpel of Peace</hi> among them, <hi>Viz. a Peace-bringing Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other obſervable I ſhall add to ſhow as their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> ſo their obſervance of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the time of the late <hi>Revolution,</hi> when man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in hopes there was <hi>no King in Iſrael,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have done what they ſaw good in their own eyes: Several of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to fetch certain <hi>Sheep</hi> in poſſeſſion of the Indians inhabiting a ſmall Iſland Adjacent to <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> which Sheep they aſſerted were Stolen from them, who met with repulſe; the <hi>Sachim</hi> leaſt there ſhould happen any miſunderſtanding of that matter, immediately<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104473:23"/>makes his report to me in theſe words, <hi>Viz. Several of your Engliſh have been on my Iſland, and would have forceably taken Sheep from thence; and we are much threatned therewith; I am doubtful if they perſiſt in that Reſolution, it may Occaſion Blood-ſhed: you know that while your Grand-father and my Father lived, there never happened any difference in ſuch things, nor hope will be Occaſion given by me. I deſire the ſame Amity may be continued, nor can the Engliſh ſay, that we have not manifeſted our Allegiance to the King by a continued Subjection. And although it is true, we have deſired your Order ſhould come to us, rather than your Officer, which hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been obſerved; yet we are willing in Caſe the Engliſh pretend any thing ours have injured them in; let an Officer by writ from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doe his duty, then we ſhall know how in an orderly way, to be relieved; yet ſhall the leaſt Boy bringing your Order, as in your Grand-fathers time, Command any thing: And if you ſee cauſe on any complaint about our Sheep, your may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all of them; hoping to find as hitherto a deciſion by the Rules of Juſtice: We hope we ſhall not ſee (as is too much practiſed in other places) an Engliſh-man, pretending an Indian to be in his debt, to come to our Houſes and pay himſelf; or in other caſes beat our People; but as hitherto we may have equal Juſtice, being the King Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and Violence and Riot committed on our<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104473:24"/>People by the Engliſh may be eſteemed of the ſame nature and quality as ours againſt them; of which, with the Juſtices, we pray you would Conſider, and take ſpeedy care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall as to their <hi>Government</hi> only add; that in their ſeveral <hi>Plantations</hi> or <hi>Town-ſhips,</hi> they Elect <hi>three</hi> or more to joyn with the <hi>Sachims</hi> (or Lords of the place) who hold <hi>Courts,</hi> for iſſuing ſuch Controverſies as happen among them, the <hi>Sachim</hi> preſiding in ſuch Courts, or in caſe <hi>he</hi> decline that Office, another is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in his place: if either party diſlike the Judgment given, he Appeals to a <hi>Superiour Court,</hi> which conſiſts of ſome of the moſt eſteemed of each place, being ſome of their <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> where ſome <hi>Principal Sachims</hi> is Elected to preſide for one Year: and from this Court an Appeal lyes to the <hi>Engliſh Court.</hi> In giving Judgment, they obſerve ſuch rules and orders made and recorded among themſelves, and the <hi>Engliſh Law,</hi> the knowledge whereof they much aſpire unto. They have likewiſe ſome among them, whom the leſs able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, or defend their own Caſes, imploy as <hi>Attornies;</hi> ſome of which are to admiration <hi>Critical</hi> in their pleadings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104473:24"/>I ſhall cloſe the whole when I have told the Reader, that their Children are generally taught to <hi>Read,</hi> and many to <hi>Write;</hi> in one of their Towns the laſt Winter, <hi>Viz.</hi> 1693. <hi>Thirty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> were at School, Twenty more of the ſame place, at the ſame time, accidentally, being not ſupplyed with Books, could not attend it. Such who are too far diſtant from any School are often taught by ſome of their Neighbours. In diverſe places are leſſer Schools.</p>

And once I had the advantage to Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh many of the Heathen, and of the chief of them, by Gods anſwering Prayers in the preſence of many Heathen, by raiſing a very Sick <hi>Indian Lad (Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh alſo preſent)</hi> after the Lad was given over by <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was ſpeechleſs; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Powaws</hi> had <hi>Powawed,</hi> and given that Sentence, that the <hi>Lad</hi> would Dye; but he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to this Day: The Story is too large to write, but I believe God did Glorifie Himſelf in the ſight of the Heathen, according to Humble and Earneſt Petitions, made in the preſence of about <hi>Thirty</hi> Heathen: all ſeemed to be much Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and awakened. One very Witty and Wiſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> there preſent told me, he would be a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> but he was afraid his heart would not be right, without which Profeſſion would be in vain, and he was afraid <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> would be his Ruine, he ſhould not forbear, but he owned and almoſt all preſent, when I Prayed, Our God was the Great and True God, but they were Poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and they did not know Him. Of theſe things and much more many <hi>Engliſh</hi> witneſſes are alive, but ſome are dead. I have heard alſo the Reverend <hi>Mr. Fitch</hi> did at the Requeſt of the <hi>Mohegs,</hi> keep a <hi>Faſt</hi> for <hi>Rain,</hi> in the Time of Great Drought, at the Requeſt of the Heathen,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104473:31"/>when their <hi>Powaw's</hi> had long Cryed for <hi>Rain,</hi> and God anſwered by ſending <hi>Rain</hi> the ſame day, to the great Aſtoniſhment of the Heathen.</p>

            <p>YOUR Letters were very grateful to me, by which I underſtand that you and others in your famous Univerſity of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> deſire to be informed concerning the Converted <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America:</hi> Take therefore a True Account of them in a few words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104473:34"/>It is above forty Years ſince that truly godly Man, Mr, <hi>John Elliot,</hi> Paſtour of the Church at <hi>Rocksborough,</hi> (not above a Mile from <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>) being warmed with a holy Zeal of Coverting the <hi>Americans,</hi> ſet himſelf to learn the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, that he might more eaſily and ſucceſsfully open to them the Myſteries of the Goſpel; upon account of which he has been (and not undeſervedly) called, <hi>The Apoſtle of the American Indians.</hi> This Reverend Perſon, not without very great labour, Tranſlated the whole Bible into the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue; he Tranſlated alſo ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treatiſes of Practical Divinity, and Catechiſms into their Language: Above 26 Years agoe he gathered a Church of Converted <hi>Indians</hi> in a Town called <hi>Natick;</hi> theſe <hi>Indians</hi> confeſſed their ſins with Tears, and profeſſed their Faith in Chriſt, and afterwards they and their Children were Baptized, and they were ſolemnly joyned together in a Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the ſaid Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> was the firſt that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred the Lords Supper to them. The Paſtor of that Church now is an <hi>Indian,</hi> his Name is <hi>Daniel.</hi> Beſides this Church at <hi>Natick,</hi> among our Inhabitants in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colony there are four <hi>Indian</hi> Aſſemblies, where the Name of the True God and Jeſus Chriſt is ſolemnly called upon; theſe Aſſemblies have<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104473:34"/>
               <hi>American</hi> Preachers. Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> formerly uſed to preach to them once every Fortnight, but now he is weakned with Labours and Old-age, being in the Eighty Fourth Year of his Age, and preacheth not to the <hi>Indians</hi> oftner than once in two Months.</p>
            <p>There is another Church, conſiſting only of Converted <hi>Indians,</hi> about fifty Miles from hence, in an <hi>Indian</hi> Town called <hi>Marſhippang,</hi> the firſt Paſtor in that Church was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, who being skilful in the <hi>American</hi> Language, Preached the Goſpel to them in their own Tongue. This <hi>Engliſh</hi> Paſtor is dead, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that Church has an <hi>Indian</hi> Preacher.</p>
            <p>There are beſides that, five Aſſemblies of <hi>Indians</hi> profeſſing the Name of Chriſt, not far diſtant from <hi>Marſhippang,</hi> which have <hi>Indian</hi> Preachers: <hi>John Cotton</hi> Paſtor of the Church at <hi>Plymouth</hi> (Son of my venerable Father-in-law <hi>John Cotton,</hi> formerly the famous Teacher of the Church at <hi>Boſton</hi>) hath made very great progreſs in learning the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, and is very skilful in it; he Preaches in their own Language to the laſt five mentioned Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions every Week. Moreover of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Saconet</hi> in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony, there is a great Congregation of thoſe who for diſtinction ſake are called <hi>Praying Indians,</hi> becauſe they pray to God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104473:35"/>Not far from a Promontory called <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> there are ſix Aſſemblies of Heathens who are to be reckoned as <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> amongſt whom there are Six <hi>Indian</hi> Preachers: <hi>Samuel Treat,</hi> Paſtor of a Church at <hi>Eaſtham,</hi> Preacheth to thoſe Congregations in their own Language. There are likewiſe amongſt the Iſlanders of <hi>Nantuchett</hi> a Church, with a Paſtor who was lately a Heathen, and ſeveral Meetings of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeni's,</hi> who are Inſtructed by the Converted <hi>Indians.</hi> There is alſo another Iſland, about Seven Leagues long, (called <hi>Martha's Vineyard</hi>) where are Two <hi>American</hi> Churches planted, which are more Famous than the reſt; over one of which there preſides an Ancient <hi>Indian</hi> as Paſtor, called <hi>Hiacooms: John Hiacooms,</hi> Son of the ſaid <hi>Indian</hi> Paſtor, alſo preacheth the Goſpel to his Countrey-Men. Another Church in that place <hi>John Techinoſh</hi> a Converted <hi>Indian</hi> teaches. In theſe Churches Ruling Elders of the <hi>Indians</hi> are Joyned to the Paſtors; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were choſen by the people, and when they had faſted and prayed, Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> laid their Hands on them, ſo that they were ſolemnly Ordained. All the Congregations of the Converted <hi>Indians</hi> (both the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> and thoſe that are in Church Order) every Lords Day meet together, the Paſtor or Preacher al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes begins with Prayer, and without a Form,<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104473:35"/>becauſe from the Heart; when the Ruler of the Aſſembly has ended his Prayer, the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Indians</hi> praiſe God with ſinging; ſome of them are excellent Singers: After the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he that preaches reads a place of Scripture (one or more Verſes as he will) and expounds it, gathers Doctrines from it, proves them by Scripture and Reaſons, and inferrs Uſes from them after the manner of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of whom they have been taught; then another Prayer to God in the Name of Chriſt concludes the whole Service. Thus do they meet together twice every Lords-day: They obſerve no <hi>Holy-dayes</hi> but the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> except upon ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſion, and then they ſolemnly ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part whole days, either in giving Thanks or faſting and praying with great ſervour of Mind.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came into theſe Coaſts, theſe barbarous Nations were altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the True God; hence it is that in their Prayers and Sermons they uſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Words and Terms; he that calls upon the moſt Holy Name of God, ſays, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> and alſo they have learned and borrowed many other Theological Phraſes from us. In ſhort, there are ſix Churches of Baptized <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and Eighteen Aſſemblies of <hi>Catechumeni's,</hi> profeſſing the Name of Chriſt.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104473:36"/>Of the <hi>Indians</hi> there are Four and Twenty who are Preachers of the Word of God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there are Four Engliſh Miniſters who Preach the Goſpel in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue. I am now my ſelf weary with Writing, and I fear leaſt if I ſhould add more I ſhould alſo be tedious to you; yet one thing I muſt add, (which I had almoſt forgot) That there are many of the <hi>Indian</hi> Children who have learned by heart the Catechiſm, either of that Famous Divine Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> or that put forth by the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and in their own Mother-Tongue can Anſwer to all the Queſtions in it. But I muſt end. I Salute the Profeſſors in your Univerſity; to whom I deſire you to Communicate this Letter, as Written to them alſo. Farewell, <hi>Worthy Sir;</hi> the Lord preſerve your Health for the Benefit of your Country, his Church, and of Learning.</p>
